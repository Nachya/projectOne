      <!-- About Me -->
      <h1>Lecturer at EWU. Former UX Lead at 14four. Father. Husband. Part-Time Fortune Cookie Writer. </h1>

      <div class="container">
        <p>It took me 6 years to finish college. Half of that time was spent in classes that didn't really interest me. I was a pre-nursing major. I didn't know what i wanted to do, and the healthcare industry seemed like a safe route.</p>

        <p>While I was waiting to get into nursing school, I took design classes; partly because I wanted to continue to get student loans (#RAGRETS) and because I wanted to take fun classes. I never looked back.</p>

        <!-- Goals and Aspirations -->
        <p>During my brief time in the industry, I was able to experience most everything the industry has to offer: Designing for a small studio, working in-house, and working in a traditional agency setting. I always knew that i wanted to teach, I just didn't realize the opportunity would come so soon.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <p>When I accepted the lecturer positon, I told myself that I would continue to pursue industry work, in order to stay relevant. This is a must for me.</p>

        <h2>Steal Like An Artist</h2>

        <p>This is my bible. I've read it cover to cover several times. If I could, I would buy it for each of my students. If you're reading this, buy this book today. You won't regret it.</p>

        <!-- Top 3 Favorite Foods -->
        <img src="assets/foods/yellowCurry.jpg" alt="Image Of Yellow Curry" />
        <h2>Yellow Curry</h2>
        <p>I grew up in a house where there was Thai food cooked constantly, but I was too picky to eat it. Now it's my favorite food. #ragrets</p>

        <img src="assets/foods/gravy.jpg" alt="Image Of Gravy" />
        <h2>Gravy</h2>
        <p>I always thought mashed potatoes were my favorite food. I was wrong. I love gravy. Broths in general. It's probably why I love curry.</p>

        <img src="assets/foods/tacoSoup.jpg" alt="Image Of Taco Soup" />
        <h2>Taco Soup</h2>
        <p>Beans. Someone please tell me how I can mix my love of curry with my love of beans. </p>
